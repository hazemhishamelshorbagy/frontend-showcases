Logical Rules Applied:

-Double-Entry Transfers: Every TRANSFER type transaction automatically generates two records—a DEBIT from the sender's account and a CREDIT to the receiver's account—to maintain ledger integrity.

-Realistic Spending:
  -POS: Small to medium daily expenses (1–300 KWD) at merchants like Starbucks, Talabat, and Zara.
  -ATM: Cash withdrawals (10–500 KWD) specifically linked to Debit Cards.
  -Bills: Monthly utility and telecom payments (Zain, Ooredoo, etc.).

-Channel Consistency: Transactions are distributed across Mobile, Web, and physical ATM channels.
-Status Distribution: Includes a mix of SUCCESS, FAILED (3%), and PENDING (5%) statuses to test UI error handling and loading states.
-Chronological Order: All 400 transactions are sorted by created_at over the last 6 months.
