🛠️ Key Implementation Rules
    
    -Action Tracking: Records a variety of events from simple LOGIN_SUCCESS to administrative changes like LIMIT_INCREASE_REQUESTED.
    -Severity Levels:
       -INFO: Standard user activity (Logins, profile views).
       -HIGH: Sensitive changes that impact financial security (Password changes, credit limit requests, new beneficiaries).
    -Traceability: Every log includes a timestamp and ip_address, allowing for the reconstruction of a user's session in case of a security incident.
    -Outcome Mapping: Uses the status field to distinguish between completed actions and thwarted attempts (e.g., LOGIN_FAILED).

💡 Dashboard Use Case
   -Customer Activity Feed: Show the user their own recent activity so they can verify that all actions (like a beneficiary addition) were performed by them.
   -Fraud Investigation: If a customer reports a missing balance, an admin can filter these logs by user_id and severity: "HIGH" to see if a password was recently changed from an unusual IP.
   -Regulatory Reporting: Export these logs to satisfy Central Bank of Kuwait requirements for "immutable audit trails" on financial transactions and profile modifications.
