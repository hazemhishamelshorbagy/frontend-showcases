         -biometric_enabled: Can be used to trigger FaceID or Fingerprint prompts on mobile login.
         -privacy_level: Can determine how much sensitive data (like full account numbers) is masked in the UI.

💡 Dashboard Integration Tip
   -State Management: Load this JSON as part of your initial "User Profile" fetch so the app renders in the correct language and theme immediately.
   -Privacy Logic: If privacy_level is HIGH, consider blurring account balances on the home screen until the user clicks an "eye" icon to reveal them.
   -Notification Opt-in: Use notifications_enabled as a gatekeeper before calling your push notification service for transaction alerts.
